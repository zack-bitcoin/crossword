c(puzzle_maker).%this compiles the program. you only need to do it once.
D = crossword:load_dict().%this takes several seconds.
[PuzzleText, Hints] = puzzle_maker:make_4_5(D).

[{<<"slamhaleabitrearelse">>,
  [<<"slam">>,<<"hale">>,<<"abit">>,<<"rear">>,<<"else">>],

Navigating the files
==========

[Here are the 20 000 most common words, according to google](20k.txt)

[Here are the words from a dictionary from 1913. It is on project Gutenburg](dictionary2.csv)

[here are the 4x5 puzzles in a plain text data file](4_5_puzzles.txt) other files in the same folder contain more puzzles. Does not contain hints.

[this program](puzzle_maker.erl) is able to choose a random puzzle from 4_5_puzzles.txt, and generate the hints for it.

[this program](crossword.erl) is able to look at the 20k words from google, find the subset of them that are defined in the dictionary from 1913, and then generate all possible crossword puzzles for a given board using those words. Only tracks words with 3 or more letters.

example of using crossword to find all combinations of words that make valid boards:
```
c(crossword).%this compiles the program. you only need to do it once.
D = crossword:load_dict().
Boards = crossword:word_combos(D).
```
